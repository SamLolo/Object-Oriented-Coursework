# ECM1410 - Object Oriented Programming

As part of the 1st year object-oriented programming module, we we're required to implement the backend of a social media platform, using a provided interface as a template for the methods that needed to be implemented for the platform to function correctly. As part of this, we needed to write our own tests to check the behaviour of our program during development.

The development was carried out using the pair-programming paradigm, and we were awarded 77% in the module overall.
